**Cookie Heist Game**

**Main Gameplay loop:** The player spawns in a hallway filled with guards and traps, they need to make their way to the cookie jar at the end of the hallway while avoiding traps and distracting guards without getting spotted.   
   Once at the jar, the player will decide how many cookies they want to take, each cookie is worth a certain amount of points. These cookies reduce the stats of the player, so they have to decide if they should take multiple in one trip, or if they make multiple trips.

**Input controls:** The game uses WASD for the top-down movement and mouse controls to shoot cookies. There will also be an input for sprinting / slowing down, likely the shift key.

Player parameters: The player needs to have a wide variety of stats that can be nerfed by carrying too many cookies\!

* Speed: Affects running speed and sneaking speed, taking too many slowdown cookies might make a section impossible\!\!  
* Noise: How close you can be walking to a guard outside of their line of sight without them hearing you.  
* Size: How big the player is, makes it easier to be spotted by guards and cameras (does not affect hitbox for traps)  
* Accuracy: Affects throwing accuracy, speed, and distance

Will update with more stuff later, but these are the basics
